# Adventure Engine v3.0

> A C-based text adventure game engine with multiplayer team-building capabilities

## Project Overview

Adventure Engine is a modular text adventure game engine built in C (C11 standard) that supports both single-player and multiplayer gameplay. It features a clean architecture, smart terminal UI, flexible world scripting system, and collaborative gameplay mechanics.

## Key Capabilities

- Single-player text adventure engine with parser, world system, inventory
- Multiplayer sessions (2-8 players) with tmux-based real-time dashboards
- Role-based gameplay: LEADER, SCOUT, ENGINEER, MEDIC, DIPLOMAT, SPECIALIST
- World file format (.world) for creating custom adventures without coding
- Save/load system with multiple save slots
- Smart terminal UI with scrolling, context-aware coloring, status bar
- Named pipe IPC for real-time state synchronization

## Technology Stack

- Language: C (C11 standard)
- Build System: Make
- Dependencies: ncurses, readline, tmux
- Test Framework: Custom test suite

## For AI Agents

When working with this codebase:
1. Single-player engine is production-ready (v2.0 complete)
2. Multiplayer infrastructure exists but integration is TODO
3. All code compiles with -Wall -Wextra with zero warnings
4. Run `make run-tests` to validate changes
5. World files in `worlds/` provide examples of the .world format
